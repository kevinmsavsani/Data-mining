The dataset folder consists of two files : 
	train.txt
	test.txt
These files can be used for training and testing the language identification models.

The class labels used are :
	as	(Assamese)
	bn	(Bengali)
	en	(English)
	oth (Hindi)
	ne	(Named Entities)
	amb	(Ambiguous)
	
Data preprocessing : Since the total number of named entities and ambiguous words are less, you can club them into a single class.


Evaluation metrics to be used:
	Class wise Presion, Recall, Fscore
	Macro average Precision, Recall, Fscore and Accuracy
	
The raw_sentences.txt can be used to train the representation learning models.
